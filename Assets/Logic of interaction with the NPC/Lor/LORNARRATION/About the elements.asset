  Titel: About the elements
  Narrations: "People often wonder how we can isolate just six elements to explain
    all things. Could the whole world exist of Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Light and
    Darkness? Of course not. \r\nThat's just a simplification for working magic.
    The real world contains hundreds, if not thousands of elements. The six used
    by sorcerers are the basic ones. The other elements are too intractable to human
    control.\r\n"
