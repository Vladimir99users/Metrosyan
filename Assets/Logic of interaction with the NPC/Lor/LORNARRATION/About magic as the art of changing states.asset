  Titel: About magic as the art of changing states
  Narrations: "Human magic is fickle and fragile. As a rule, it takes two others
    to move magic from one state to another. What does this mean?\r\nFor example,
    we want to get the Energy of Air. What is needed to do this? Wind Spirit and
    Wind Matter.\r"
