  Titel: About the structure of the world
  Narrations: 'A common misconception is the idea that energy is primary over matter
    and spirit. However, even first-year students of a mediocre magical institution
    know that magic is primary.

    Everything in the world is made up of magic.
    It only exists in its three states: Spirit, Energy, and Matter. Each of these
    states can flow into the other.

    Witchcraft is a process of transferring
    magic from one state to another.
